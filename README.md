This is a sample app built in IOS that can do calls on the IOS Speech API engine.

Code has been compiled to **Swift 5**.

Code compatible with **Xcode 11.0** and **IOS 13.2** for both **IPhone** and **IPad**.


## Welcome Screen

Since it's only a sample app, its design is purely functional.

## Warning Rules coded

When ever accessing outside I/O IOS needs to ask permission to user.

## Using the app

After pressing **Start Listening!** the IOS Speech Engine starts to listen to any audio and makes calls to the speech to text API and output text to user.

It can even recognize name entity

## Talking back

The **Talk** button will consider all text present on the screen and call the IOS Speech Engine to translate the text into speech using the Siri API.

## Open Project

This is an open project free for everyone to clone and use.

I used this project as a demonstration of the accuracy of the **IOS Speech Engine**. 

As a personal conclusion it is very easy to use it performs very well when given clean audio input.
